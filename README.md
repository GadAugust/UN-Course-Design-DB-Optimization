# UN-Course-Design-DB-Optimization
## Project Introduction

Welcome to the "UN-Course-Design-DB-Optimization" project repository! This initiative stems from the need to enhance the academic management system at the University of Northampton England by leveraging modern database practices. The project revolves around a carefully curated dataset containing information on newly developed computing courses.

## Problem Statement:

In the landscape of academic course management at the University of Northampton, there exists a critical need for a more optimized and streamlined database system. The current state, characterized by disparate datasets and less-than-ideal data structures, poses challenges in efficiently managing and extracting meaningful insights from the information related to newly developed computing courses.

## Objective:

This project aims to address these challenges by implementing an optimized database system that aligns with best practices in data engineering. Through careful design, implementation, and documentation processes, we aim to enhance the overall management of computing courses at the University of Northampton, providing a foundation for informed decision-making and improved academic outcomes.
